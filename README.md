## What is Rumble?
A full-stack web application which provides a list of eateries to the user based on their preferences. For instance, if the user wants mexican food at a low cost in San Jose within a 10 mile radius, 
the API will return a list of eateries which best fit those preferences

## How Does Rumble Work?
The application utilizes the Yelp API, specifically the business search endpoint, to make a GET request with the paramaters inserted by the user.
